Exercise 3: Debugging JavaScript Functions


Code:
function calculateSum(arr) {
let sum = 0;
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
sum += arr[i];
}
return sum;
}

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const result = calculateSum(numbers);
console.log(result); // Should output 15


The provided JavaScript function, calculateSum, seems to be mostly correct. However, there are no errors or inefficiencies in the code snippet  provided. It is designed to calculate the sum of the elements in an array and returns the correct result.
